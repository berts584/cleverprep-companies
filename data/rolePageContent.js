      roleDescription: "Technical Program Managers (TPMs) at Google drive the execution of complex, cross-functional technical programs that span multiple teams, products, and sometimes years. You'll be the connective tissue between engineering, product, and business teams, ensuring that ambitious technical initiatives are delivered on time, on budget, and with the intended impact. Google TPMs work on some of the most challenging programs in tech: launching new products to billions of users, migrating massive infrastructure systems, coordinating hardware/software integration for devices like Pixel and Nest, or orchestrating multi-year platform initiatives. The role requires deep technical understanding (many TPMs have engineering backgrounds), exceptional organizational skills, and the ability to influence without authority across a matrixed organization. Unlike project managers at other companies, Google TPMs are expected to understand system architecture, make technical tradeoffs, and earn credibility with senior engineers. Career growth follows a clear path from TPM → Senior TPM → Staff TPM → Principal TPM, with opportunities to lead increasingly complex programs or transition to engineering management or product roles.",

Google invented the SRE discipline, and you'll work on systems that handle billions of requests per second, store exabytes of data, and serve users across every country on Earth. SREs combine software engineering skills with systems expertise to build automation, improve reliability, and ensure that Google's products - Search, YouTube, Gmail, Cloud - achieve their availability targets (often 99.99% or higher). The role involves writing code to automate operations, designing systems for reliability, responding to incidents, and working with development teams to build reliability into products from the start. Google SREs enjoy a unique position: you're an engineer first, with expectations to spend at least 50% of your time on development work rather than operational toil.

The firm's substantial technology investments, 'One Firm' collaborative culture, and institutional client focus create an environment where quant traders can build sophisticated strategies with appropriate capital and time horizons.

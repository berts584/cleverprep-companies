      roleDescription: `Data Scientists at IBM build the AI and analytics solutions that transform how the world's largest organizations make decisions. Working with IBM's watsonx AI platform and enterprise data infrastructure, you'll develop machine learning models, analyze complex datasets, and create insights for Fortune 500 clients across industries like finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. IBM's data science practice combines cutting-edge AI research—from IBM Research labs that have pioneered breakthroughs in natural language processing and computer vision—with practical enterprise implementation. Data Scientists collaborate closely with IBM Consulting teams to deploy models in production for real business impact. The role requires both technical depth and business acumen: understanding client problems, translating them into data science solutions, and communicating results to non-technical stakeholders. IBM invests heavily in data science talent development through programs like the IBM Data Science Community and access to IBM Research resources.`,
